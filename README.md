Learning Ciphers The Hard Way
-----------------------------

In today's world data encryption has become really important. With the increase
in the number of malicious attacks on websites, securing data from being
misused has become an issue. Developing websites that are entirely immune to
such attacks is difficult. One nasty user input bypasses the form filter and
Bang, the site security is breached, allowing the bad guys to misuse private
data. This is where data encryption comes into play.

It involves converting information into ciphers and codes to stop unauthorized
access. I have created this book to cover the fundamentals of encryption so you
can apply them in the practical world. But I want you to learn it the hard way.
And by **hard way** I really mean the **Hard Way**.
